# Hello there, health tech enthusiasts! 👋🩺

Welcome to our **COVID-19 X-Ray Detector Flask App** project. This is where we're using the power of machine learning to detect COVID-19 from chest X-ray images.

## What's it all about? 🤔

This project is a Flask-based web application that uses ensemble modeling and progressive image scaling to recognize COVID-19 from medical CT scan imaging. It achieves over 86% accuracy, which is pretty impressive!

## How does it work? 🛠️
### 1> Clone the repo 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ManikantaSanjay/covid_xray_detector_flask_app.git
```

### 2> Change the Directory

cd covid_xray_detector_flask_app
```
### 3> Installing the Requirements
```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

### 4> Running the Flask App
```bash
flask run app.py
```
